##More sales, higher conversions and less hassle!##
Popify shows you're a trustworthy store. It shows that other people are already buying from you. It shows your store is busy, and most importantly, it shows that people want and need your products. 
People feel more comfortable with their buying decision when they know others have also bought the same product or service and had a good experience with it.
Consumers who experience FOMO (fear of missing out), are more likely to purchase faster.
